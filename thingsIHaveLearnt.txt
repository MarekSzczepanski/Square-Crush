Some unexpected things I have learnt during the project:
1) How to make keyframes animations in JS.
2) When animate method was used to change div's position, other animation has to be used to change it's position again. Example:

I have used this to change div's top value in NewSquaresAfterCrush.js:

iSquare.animate([
    {top: topNewSquare}, 
    {top: topISquare}
    ], 
    { 
    duration: 2000,
    fill: "forwards"
});

and then tried to use this in SqareSwitcher.js, but it didn't work:

clickedSquare.style.top = position;
secondSquare.style.top = position2;

So I had to use animate method in SquareSwitcher too:

clickedSquare.animate([
    {top: position2}, 
    {top: position}
    ], 
    { 
    duration: 2000,
    fill: "forwards"
});
secondSquare.animate([
    {top: position}, 
    {top: position2}
    ], 
    { 
    duration: 2000,
    fill: "forwards"
});

It took me two hours to figure it out.
