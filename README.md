# Square Crush  
##### Candy Crush Saga tribute  

#### Introduction
Square crush is a browser game inspired by Candy Crush Saga, which is my wife's favorite mobile game. I have created this project because I wanted to explain her what programming is, on a familliar example. This project was also a good oppor to learn object oriented programming in JS in practice. This project has not been influenced by any tutorial, the code was created from scratch, exclusively by me.
