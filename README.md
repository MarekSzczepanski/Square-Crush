# Square Crush  
##### Candy Crush Saga tribute  

#### Introduction
Square crush is a browser game inspired by Candy Crush Saga, which is my wife's favorite mobile game. I have created this project because I wanted to explain her what programming is, on a familliar example. This project was also a good oppor to learn object oriented programming in JS in practice. This project has not been influenced by any tutorial, the code was created from scratch, exclusively by me.

## Recent changes
1) Add horizontal crush.  
2) Make more than 3x crush possible (by removing unnecessary code).  
3) Remove some more unnecessary classes in index.html.  
4) Add row classes to avoid horizontal crush bugs (for example crushing squares 5, 6 and 7 because of id number crushing formula).  
5) Create new object - NewSquaresAfterCrush.js, which is a method taken from SpaceChecker.js.
