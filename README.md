# Square Crush  
##### Candy Crush Saga tribute  

#### Introduction
Square crush is a browser game inspired by Candy Crush Saga, which is my wife's favorite mobile game. I have created this project because I wanted to explain her what programming is, on a familliar example. This project was also a good oppor to learn object oriented programming in JS in practice. This project has not been influenced by any tutorial, the code was created from scratch, exclusively by me.

## Recent changes
1) Add animations for all falling blocks.  
2) Merge four loops from SpaceChecker.js into one function with parameters.  
3) Merge animate functions from Crush.js into one function with parameters.  
4) Remove some unused classes from index.html.  
5) Rename main SpaceChecker.js method.
6) Add flag to SpaceChecker.js which informs the method if it has to repeat or not. If flag is true, SpaceChecker.js repeats looking for more spaces, if flag is false it creates new Crush.js object looking for possible crushes.  
7) Add a loop to Crush.js, which segregates all the squares (by id number), by adding them to an array.  
8) Remove unnecessary code from InitialSquares.js.  
9) Whole vertical crush (3x) and space checking works.
